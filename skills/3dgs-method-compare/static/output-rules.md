### Detailed Analysis

#### Primitive Representation
[Paragraph comparing the fundamental representational differences]

#### Design Trade-offs
[Analysis of what each method gains and sacrifices]

#### Recommendation
- For novel view synthesis: [Best choice] because ...
- For surface reconstruction: [Best choice] because ...
- For real-time rendering: [Best choice] because ...
```

## Rules

1. **Be technically precise**: Never oversimplify differences. If two methods differ in their opacity parameterization, explain exactly how.
2. **Quote metrics when available**: Use actual numbers from papers, not estimates.
3. **Avoid bias**: Present each method's strengths and weaknesses fairly.
4. **Context matters**: A method that's worse on PSNR might be better for real-time. Always mention the use case.
5. **Flag uncertainty**: If you don't have reliable data for a comparison dimension, say so explicitly.
